1. Why this project? (The Problem)

Through market research, I found that while YouTube Music is growing fast, Korean users face several "Pain Points":

Complex UI: Cluttered categories make it hard to find music.

Missing Essentials: No real-time lyrics and lack of multi-selection for songs.

Information Gap: Hidden bundle and pricing details.



2. Solutions (AS-IS vs. TO-BE)

I focused on transforming the experience from "Cluttered" to "Customizable."
